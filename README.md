# LG-Ultrafine-Brightness

A tool to adjust brightness of LG Ultrafine 4k/5K on Windows without the help of Bootcamp. I built my own PC and made this tool to adjust brightness through my PC.

This project is derived from [https://github.com/unknownzerx/lguf-brightness](https://github.com/unknownzerx/lguf-brightness).

The original tool was unable to adjust brightness in Windows 10 and I also made some minor improvements to it like showing current brightness and efficiency while adjusting.


### Usage

```
Press '-' or '=' to adjust brightness.
Press '[' or: ']' to fine tune.
Press 'p' to use the minimum brightness
Press '' to use the maximum brightness
Press 'q' to quit.
```
